## Step 2: Download and Extract WalkerSim2

## Troubleshooting

- **Game won't launch or errors appear?**
    - Ensure that the mod is placed directly inside the `Mods` folder (no nested folders like `Mods\WalkerSim2\WalkerSim2\ModInfo.xml`).
    - Double-check that the WalkerSim2 version matches your installed game version.

- **Still having problems?**
    - Refer to the official WalkerSim2 documentation or community support channels.

## Important: Check for 0_TFP_Harmony

WalkerSim2 depends on a core mod called `0_TFP_Harmony`, which should already be present in your `Mods` folder.

- **If `0_TFP_Harmony` is missing:**
  1. Open **Steam**.
  2. Right-click on **7 Days to Die** and select **Properties**.
  3. Go to the **Installed Files** tab.
  4. Click **Verify integrity of game files**.

Steam will scan your installation and automatically restore any missing files, including `0_TFP_Harmony`.
