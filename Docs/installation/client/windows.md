## Step 1: Locate Your 7 Days to Die Game Folder

1. Open **Steam**.
2. Go to your **Library** and find **7 Days to Die**.
3. Right-click the game and select **Manage > Browse local files**.
4. This will open the main 7 Days to Die installation directory.

Example path:
> ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die```

---

## Step 2: Download and Extract WalkerSim2

1. Download the latest WalkerSim2 release, e.g., `WalkerSim2-0.9.3.zip`.
2. Use an extraction tool like **7-Zip** or **WinRAR** to unpack the archive.
3. You should get a folder named:
> ```WalkerSim2```

---

## Step 3: Install WalkerSim2

1. Navigate to the `Mods` folder inside your 7 Days to Die installation directory.
2. Move the **WalkerSim2** folder you extracted into the `Mods` folder.

Your folder structure should look like:

> ```7 Days To Die\Mods\WalkerSim2\```

Inside the `WalkerSim2` folder, you should see files like `ModInfo.xml` and other related files and folders.

---

## Step 4: Launch the Game

1. Start **7 Days to Die** through **Steam**.
2. WalkerSim2 should automatically load if installed correctly.
3. Start a new game or continue an existing one.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Game won't launch or errors appear?**
    - Ensure that the mod is placed directly inside the `Mods` folder (no nested folders like `Mods\WalkerSim2\WalkerSim2\ModInfo.xml`).
    - Double-check that the WalkerSim2 version matches your installed game version.

- **Still having problems?**
    - Refer to the official WalkerSim2 documentation or community support channels.

## Important: Check for 0_TFP_Harmony

WalkerSim2 depends on a core mod called `0_TFP_Harmony`, which should already be present in your `Mods` folder.

- **If `0_TFP_Harmony` is missing:**
  1. Open **Steam**.
  2. Right-click on **7 Days to Die** and select **Properties**.
  3. Go to the **Installed Files** tab.
  4. Click **Verify integrity of game files**.

Steam will scan your installation and automatically restore any missing files, including `0_TFP_Harmony`.
