# WalkerSim 2

## What Does This Mod Do?

WalkerSim 2 changes how zombies work in 7 Days to Die.

Normally, zombies just appear randomly near you. With this mod, zombies exist all the time on the map - even when you can't see them.

## How It Works

Think of it like this: The mod creates a pretend version of your game map. Thousands of virtual zombies walk around on this pretend map all the time.

These virtual zombies can:

- Walk on roads
- Group together
- Hang around buildings
- Wander around randomly

They keep walking around whether you are near them or not.

When a virtual zombie gets close to where you are, the mod makes it turn into a real zombie in your game.

Below is a visual example of the simulation in action (sped up for better demonstration):
