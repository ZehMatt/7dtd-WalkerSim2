# WalkerSim 2

## What Does This Mod Do?

WalkerSim 2 changes how zombies work in 7 Days to Die.

Normally, zombies just appear randomly near you. With this mod, zombies exist all the time on the map - even when you can't see them.

## How It Works

Think of it like this: The mod creates a pretend version of your game map. Thousands of virtual zombies walk around on this pretend map all the time.

These virtual zombies can:

- Walk on roads
- Group together
- Hang around buildings
- Wander around randomly
- React to sounds like gunfire, explosions, and breaking glass

They keep walking around whether you are near them or not.

When a virtual zombie gets close to where you are, the mod makes it turn into a real zombie in your game.

## Sound Awareness

One of the key features of WalkerSim is that virtual zombies react to sounds you make in the game world:

- **Gunfire** - Shooting weapons attracts zombies from the surrounding area
- **Explosions** - TNT, grenades, and other explosives draw zombies toward the blast
- **Breaking materials** - Smashing glass, wood, and other materials creates noise that zombies can hear
- **Other loud activities** - Any noise you make can influence where zombies move in the simulation

This means your actions have consequences beyond what you can see. Fire a gun in the woods, and zombies from far away will start wandering in your direction, even if they can't spawn immediately. By the time you return to that area later, you might find it swarming with zombies drawn to the noise you made earlier.

You can configure how sensitive zombies are to sounds using the [EnhancedSoundAwareness](configuring/configuration/base.md#enhancedsoundawareness) and [SoundDistanceScale](configuring/configuration/base.md#sounddistancescale) settings.

Below is a visual example of the simulation in action (sped up for better demonstration):
